# AB_Testing


### Project Overview
We are running an experiment at an item level, which means all users who visit will see the same page. However, the layout of different item pages may differ. We will calculate the order binary, view binary and average views and orders for the 30-day window after the test assignment for item_test_2.


### Data Sources


### Tools
- 
- [ABBA](https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html) is used to compute the lifts in metrics and the p-values for the binary metrics ( 30 day order binary and 30 day view binary) using a interval 95% confidence.
